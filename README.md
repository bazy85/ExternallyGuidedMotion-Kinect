### Kinect_Program

Some of this code is a modified version of the example code provided by ABB. 
This program extracts position data from the person closest to the Kinect sensor and forward this data to a program
in Robotstudio using UdPUc and Protobuf. 
Together with the program in Robotstudio, this program is used to control the motion of an ABB robotic arm with 
External Guided Motion implemented.

The program in Robotstudio can be found by following this link:
