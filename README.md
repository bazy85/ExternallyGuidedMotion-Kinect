### Kinect_Program

Some of this code is a modified version of the example code provided by ABB. 
This program extracts position data from the person closest to the Kinect sensor and forward this data to a program
in Robotstudio using UdPUc and Protobuf. 
Together with the program in Robotstudio, this program is used to control the motion of an Irb 140 ABB robotic arm with 
External Guided Motion implemented.

The Pack and go file for the Robotstudio set up and source file is located in the folder Robotstudio
